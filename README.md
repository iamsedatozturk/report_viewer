# Reporting for React -  Add a Web Document Viewer to a React App (Vite)

This example incorporates the Web Document Viewer into a client-side app built with React. The example consists of two parts:

- The [ServerApp](ServerApp) folder contains the backend project. The project is an ASP.NET Core application that enables [cross-domain requests (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) (Access-Control-Allow-Origin) and implements custom web report storage.

- The [react-document-viewer](react-document-viewer) folder contains the client application built with React.

## Quick Start

### Server

In the *ServerApp* folder, run the following command:

```
dotnet run
```

The server starts at http://localhost:5000. To debug the server, run the application in Visual Studio.

### Client

In the *react-document-viewer* folder, run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to the URL specified in the command output to see the result. The application displays the Web Document Viewer with the *TestReport* report.
